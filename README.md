## CI/CD Testing

This is a repo to use to play around with CI/CD as part of the MLOps Foundations Course by Noah Gift from Duke and Coursera. The project was faithfully reproduced from on-line lectures and updated to capture current versions of python and included libraries like pytest, black, pylint.
